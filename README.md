## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. You can view puzzles and participate by signing in with a GitHub, Google, Reddit, or Twitter account. Each puzzle has a sample input data, and the expexted result to make testing easy. This is the same for everyone, and also accessible without registering (although you will not see Part 2 of the puzzle without registering and solving Part 1). The real input is unique for each user. To evaluate if the program works ok for your input, paste your data into the input1.txt/input2.txt/input7.txt respectlively, and run the program. You can submit the result on the puzzle page.
